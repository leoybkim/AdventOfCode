## Point in polygon

> One simple way of finding whether the point is inside or outside a simple polygon is to test how many times a ray,
> starting from the point and going in any fixed direction, intersects the edges of the polygon. If the point is on the
> outside of the polygon the ray will intersect its edge an even number of times. If the point is on the inside of the
> polygon then it will intersect the edge an odd number of times. The status of a point on the edge of the polygon depends
> on the details of the ray intersection algorithm.
